{"name":"CakePHP Bower","tagline":"CakePHP Plugin for Twitter Bower","body":"This plugin makes it possible for a [CakePHP](http://cakephp.org) application (along with its plugins) to utilize the power of [Twitter Bower](http://twitter.github.com/bower/) for package management.\r\n\r\nThe main responsibility of this plugin is to check what packages the current CakePHP application depends on, and download them to a specific directory under `app/webroot`.\r\n\r\n# Requirement\r\n\r\nThe plugin is compatible with CakePHP 2.x.\r\n\r\nYou will also need Bower installed globally via [npm](https://npmjs.org/package/bower):\r\n\r\n    $ npm install -g bower\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nClone/Download the plugin to `app/Plugin/Bower`.\r\n\r\nWhen the plugin's shell is first run, it will automatically create a file at `app/.bowerrc` and a directory at `app/webroot/components/`. \r\n\r\nBut to avoid any unexpected file permission issues, it is recommended you do the following manually:\r\n\r\n* Copy `app/Plugin/Bower/.bowerrc.default` to `app/.bowerrc`\r\n* Create a directory at `app/webroot/components`\r\n\r\nAnd of course, load this plugin from your `app/Config/bootstrap.php`:\r\n\r\n    CakePlugin::load('Bower');\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nGiven your CakePHP project depends on jQuery v1.9.1, it is expected you will have a file JSON file at `app/component.json` with this info:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      \"name\": \"my-cakephp-app\",\r\n      \"version\": \"0.0.1\",\r\n      \"dependencies\": {\r\n        \"jquery\": \"~1.9.1\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNow if we run this command from the `app` directory, Bower will download jQuery to `app/webroot/components/jquery/`:\r\n\r\n    $ ./Console/cake Bower.bower fetch app\r\n\r\nPlugins can have their own `component.json` file too, and they need to be located at `app/Plugin/MyPlugin/component.json`.\r\n\r\nTo download dependencies of a plugin:\r\n\r\n    $ ./Console/cake Bower.bower fetch MyPlugin\r\n\r\nIf you wish to download all the dependencies of your `app` and all your Plugins together in one go:\r\n\r\n    $ ./Console/cake Bower.bower fetch .\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\nYou may wish to change the directory where packages are downloaded to, or even the name of the JSON file. You can do that by modifying the `app/.bowerrc` file.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n[MIT License](https://github.com/fahad19/cakephp-bower/blob/master/LICENSE.txt)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
